# Overview

This project was needed to form a good foundation of programming concepts and was helpful in ensuring I understand the development process and how an IDE, Git, and GIthub are used.

The software prints Hello World to the console.

The purpose behind this software was more about ensuring that the git/github connections are working correctly. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
